Fixed syntax errors such as missing variable assignments for personalMessageInput and courseNameInput.
Updated the certificate content generation to include the personalMessage and courseName inputs in the certificate template. Also included the image, also added some paragraphs and made the courseName to be strong.
Added an event listener to the close button to hide the modal when clicked, and also fixed the cursor to pointer.
